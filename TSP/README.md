## TSP algorithm
Traveling salesman problem (TSP) algorithm is used to find the shortest path to visit all the cities. 
In this program you should modify the following variables before you run it.
1. Iteration times of TSP algo, the "iteration" variable. (default == 500)
2. Coordinates file of the retangles, the "line/path" variable.
3. The result of the routing planning, the "outpath" variable.
